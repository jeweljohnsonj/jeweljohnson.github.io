Violin-plot\nSummary\nReferences\n\nIn this tutorial we will be plotting different types of graphs using the package ggplot2 in R. The ggplot2 is an excellent package which can used to create beautiful data visualizations. It has been created and developed by Dr. Hadley Wickham. At the very heart of a ggplot graph we have a dataset which we want to plot, a coordinate system which acts as the environment for the plot and ‘geoms’- which can be tweaked to get different aesthetics for the graph.\nThis tutorial is primarily focused on students who are beginners in R programming and wants to quickly plot their data without much of a hassle. So without further ado let us get started!\nSetting up the prerequisites\nFirst we need to install the ggplot2 package in R as it does not come in the standard distribution of R.\nTo install packages in R we use the command install.packages() and to load packages we use the command library(). Therefore to install and load ggplot2 package we use the following lines of command.\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nAll right we have the ggplot2 package loaded, now we just need some data to plot. Most R programming tutorials uses the iris dataset for showing examples. This tutorial won’t be like most tutorials. So let me introduce you to the lovely penguins from Palmer Station in Antarctica!\nFor this tutorial we will be installing the palmerpenguins package which showcases body measurements taken from three different species of penguins from Antarctica. This package was made possible by the efforts of Dr. Allison Horst. The penguin data was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER.\nInstall the palmerpenguins package and load it in R.\n\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nNow there are two datasets in this package. We will be using the penguins dataset which is a simplified version of the raw-data present in the package.\nUse the command head() to display the first few values of penguins dataset to see how it looks like\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nhead(penguins)\n\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"species\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"island\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"bill_length_mm\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"bill_depth_mm\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"flipper_length_mm\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"body_mass_g\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"sex\"],\"name\":[7],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[8],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Adelie\",\"2\":\"Torgersen\",\"3\":\"39.1\",\"4\":\"18.7\",\"5\":\"181\",\"6\":\"3750\",\"7\":\"male\",\"8\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Adelie\",\"2\":\"Torgersen\",\"3\":\"39.5\",\"4\":\"17.4\",\"5\":\"186\",\"6\":\"3800\",\"7\":\"female\",\"8\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Adelie\",\"2\":\"Torgersen\",\"3\":\"40.3\",\"4\":\"18.0\",\"5\":\"195\",\"6\":\"3250\",\"7\":\"female\",\"8\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Adelie\",\"2\":\"Torgersen\",\"3\":\"NA\",\"4\":\"NA\",\"5\":\"NA\",\"6\":\"NA\",\"7\":\"NA\",\"8\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Adelie\",\"2\":\"Torgersen\",\"3\":\"36.7\",\"4\":\"19.3\",\"5\":\"193\",\"6\":\"3450\",\"7\":\"female\",\"8\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Adelie\",\"2\":\"Torgersen\",\"3\":\"39.3\",\"4\":\"20.6\",\"5\":\"190\",\"6\":\"3650\",\"7\":\"male\",\"8\":\"2007\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  \n\nWe can see that are 8 columns in the dataset representing different values. Now let us try plotting some graphs with this data.\n1. Bar graph\nSo we will try to plot a simple bar graph first. Bar graphs are used to represent categorical data where the height of the rectangular bar represents the value for that category. From the bar graph we will be plotting, we will see the frequency data for all three species of penguins.\nWe will be using the geom_bar() command to plot the bar graph. Let us also use the command theme_bw() for the nice aesthetics.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Frequency\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Frequency of individuals for each species\") + \n  geom_bar() + theme_bw()\n\n\n2. Histogram\nHistograms are similar to bar graphs visually. But histograms are used to represent continuous data. Also the all the rectangular bars will have same bin size or width.\nWe can plot a histogram using the command geom_histogram().\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Frequency\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Frequency of individuals for respective body mass\") + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 25) + theme_bw()\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\n\n\nThe warning message indicates that for two rows in the dataset, they have NA values or that they did not have any values present. This true for real life cases, as during data collection sometimes you will be unable to collect data due to various reasons. So this is perfectly fine.\n3. Line graph\nLine graph simply joins together data points to show overall distribution.\nUse the command geom_line() for plotting a line graph.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, \n                            y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Bill length (mm)\") + ylab(\"Bill depth (mm)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Bill length vs Bill depth\") + geom_line() + theme_bw()\n\n\n4. Scatter plot\nScatter plot simply denotes the data points in the dataset.\nUse the command geom_point() to plot a scatter plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, \n                            shape = species, colour = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Body mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Flipper length (mm)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass vs Filpper length\") + geom_point(size = 2) + theme_bw()\n\n\n5. Density Plot\nDensity plots is similar to histograms but shows it shows the overall distribution of the data in a finer way. This way we will get a bell shaped curve if our data follows a normal distribution.\nUse the command geom_density() to a density plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution\") + \n  geom_density() + theme_bw()\n\n\nSince we plotted for all three species the graph looks clustered. Let us try plotting the same graph for only gentoo penguins. We will use the dplyr package to filter() data for gentoo penguins alone. The dplyr package comes in-built with R so just load the dplyr package using the command library(). The dplyr package was also developed by Dr. Hadley Wickham.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npenguins_gentoo <- penguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\")\n\nggplot(data = penguins_gentoo, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass of Gentoo penguins (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution of Gentoo penguins\") + \n  geom_density(fill = \"red\") + theme_bw()\n\n\n6. Dot-plot\nDot-plot is similar to a density plot but it shows discretely each data point in the distribution.\nUse the command geom_dotplot() to plot a dot-plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Body mass (g)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass in three diferent species of penguins\") + \n  geom_dotplot(binaxis = \"y\", stackdir = \"center\", binwidth = 100) + theme_bw()\n\n\n7. Rug-plot\nRug-plot is a simple way to visualize distribution of data along the axis lines. It is often used in conjunction with other graphical representations.\nUse the command geom_rug() to plot a rug-plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npenguins_gentoo <- penguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\")\n\nggplot(data = penguins_gentoo, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass of Gentoo penguins (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution of Gentoo penguins\") + \n  geom_point(colour = \"darkred\") + geom_rug() + theme_bw()\n\n\n8. Box-plot\nBox-plot is one of the better ways of showing data via quartiles. You can learn more about box-plots here.\nUse the command geom_boxplot() to plot a box-plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Body mass (g)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass in three diferent species of penguins\") + geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n9. Violin-plot\nViolin-plot can be considered as the best of both a box-plot and a density plot. It shows the quartile values, like in a box-plot and also shows the distribution of the data, like in a density plot.\nUse the command geom_violin() in conjunction with geom_boxplot() to plot a violin-plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Body mass (g)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass in three diferent species of penguins\") + \n  geom_violin(aes(colour = species), trim = TRUE) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\nSummary\nI hope this tutorial helped you to get familiarise with ggplot2 commands. There are many more different types of graphs that you can plot using ggplot2. The tutorial only showed some of the commonly used ones. The best way to learn R is through actually doing it yourself. Try to recreate the examples given in this tutorial by yourself and then try what you learned with the different datasets available in R. Have a good day!\nReferences\nH.
