## **Bio**

I did my Masters in Biological Sciences from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-TVM). For my master thesis I studied the limits and adaptations of nocturnal vision in the Giant Honeybee (*Apis dorsata*) in [Prof. Hema Somanathan's lab](https://faculty.iisertvm.ac.in/beelab/). I have also worked with Asian Honeybee (*Apis cerana*) and the Greater Banded Hornet (*Vespa tropica*). Currently I am applying for a PhD.

## **Research Interests**

I'm interested in behavioural ecology and visual ecology, particularly in insects. With climate change being one of the greatest problem before us I am also interested in studying the effect of climate change on animals and plants, and how do they adapt to these effects. Since most of my work were in social insects I am also interested in studying social behaviour.

## **Hobbies**

R enthusiast and data visualization | Listening to instrumental music, mainly math-rock | Stamp and coin collection | Photography (check out some of my photos [here](https://500px.com/p/jewel_johnson?view=photos)) | Cycling and Trekking
