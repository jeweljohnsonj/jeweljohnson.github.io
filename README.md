# One-carat Blog
Soruce files for the [personal website of Jewel Johnson](https://jeweljohnsonj.github.io/jeweljohnson.github.io/).

The webiste was made using the [`distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package in [R](https://www.r-project.org) and is hosted in `GitHub`.

Update (20-May-2022): I have migrated my blog from `{distill}` to `{quarto}`. You can find the new link for the blog [here](https://one-carat-blog.netlify.app/). Therefore, from here on, all new contents will only be available on the new blog.
